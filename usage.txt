Where can i find my Fire Emblem Engage Savegames ?

Yuzu: %Appdata%\yuzu\nand\user\save\0000000000000000\C65ACDC34E680A4C5BF7E30BCDD9EEC8\0100A6301214E000 (This is an Example Savepath) for more info see: https://yuzu-emu.org/wiki/user-directory/

If you have a Switch with installed Costum Firmware you can Backup and Restore your Savegames with JKSV (https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) or Similar Software.

The Savefolder should look like this:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Auto
Global
Manual0
Manual1
Manual2
Manual3
Manual4
Manual5
Manual6
Manual7
Manual8
Manual9
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Manual0 = Slot 1, Manual1 = Slot 2, Manual2 = Slot 3 and so forth


Usage Examples:

Set Support Value of Framme (フラン) and Goldmary (ゴルドマリー) [-SA 1] to 47 [-SDL] (Japanese Names for Support are Seperated by "|" English names by ":")
python "Change_Support_Level.py" -i "Manual2" -o "Manual2.Patch" -p フラン|ゴルドマリー -SDL 47 -SA 1
Altv
python "Change_Support_Level.py" -i "Manual2" -o "Manual2.Patch" -p Framme:Goldmary -SDL 47 -SA 1

[-HS] Set Support Values to 124+Support Level (You can get all Support Dialoges but risk a integer Overflow if you try to build up any more Support before Completing all Dialoge)
[-SA 2] Change all Support Levels to given Value
[-SL 0] Set Support Levels to 0: "No Support" (1:C, 2:B, 3:A)
python "Change_Support_Level.py" -i "Manual3" -o "Manual3.Patch" -HS -SA 2 -SL 0

Change support Value of all Paarings to 100 [-SDL]
python "Change_Support_Level.py" -i "Manual4" -o "Manual4.Patch" -SDL 100


Explanation:

Characters have 2 Distinct Support Bytes:

1.) Support Level: C, B, A (0-3)
2.) Support Value: 0-127

Every Support Pair is Index by a PID name: z.b "PID_フランPID_ゴルドマリー" (PID_FrammePID_Goldmary) You can lookup the Support Paarings IDs by Looking into "Sorted_Support_Paarings.txt".
The Support Level is a Byte from 0-3: (No Support, C, B, A) which Support Dialoge is unlocked is decided by the Support Value. If a specific threshold is reached a new Support Dialoge is available. If the value is high enough, several support dialogs can be conducted in succession.
If the Support Level is set by script dialoges will be Skipt if the Support Value is too low and vice versa. The Support Value is a Signed 8-bit Integer with a range of -128 to 127. if you set the Support Dialoge to 128 (as Signed integer -1) it is too low for any Support Dialoge. 
The Game will add to the Support Value if you reach a new Support Level (+1) or by other actions such as dining together, adjacent allies fighting together etc. If the Support Value is to high it will Overflow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) so keep that is mind.   

You can lookup the Japanese Character Names in the Fire Emblem wiki:
